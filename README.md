# Kucukdev, assistant for university students
Helps you with:
- Tracking your attendance
- Picking lessons in a way that they don't conflict and you like

I've picked the worst language ever(PHP) to write this solution, now it
is time we correct that wrong. It's a hobby project and any help is
appreciated.

[Kucukdev](https://www.kucukdev.org) is online and here the aim is to
replicate the behaviour for the back-end.


# Quick Start
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. `uvicorn main:app --reload`

Use auto-formatting and use `Black` for it.
