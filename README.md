# Kucukdev, assistant for university students
Helps you with:
- Tracking your attendance
- Picking lessons in a way that they don't conflict and you like

We've picked an unpopular language(PHP) to write this solution, now it
is time we correct that wrong. This repo aims to re-write the backend
for Kucukdev in FastAPI.

[Kucukdev](https://www.kucukdev.org) is online and here the aim is to
replicate the behaviour for the back-end.


# Quick Start
1. Install `Docker` and `Docker Compose`
1. `docker-compose build` to build the backend
1. `docker-compose up -d` to start the Kucukdev API
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the swagger UI
1. `docker-compose down` to down it


# Development

Use auto-formatting and use `Black` for it.
